# Introduction

Hello there! I'll cut to the chase;

I've started preparing for the Offensive Security Certified Professional exam and certification. Very early in my preparation, I realized that I needed to make my own notes of all the boxes and concepts I came across. What better way to make notes than to do it publically, in a way others can see them and hopefully gain something!

I will be primarily following [@TJ\_Null](https://twitter.com/TJ_Null)'s [OSCP like VM's list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit) and post their write-ups here along. There will also be a separate section for concepts, cheatsheets, and methodologies which I use often so that I have all my go-to resources in one place. Hopefully, this ends up being useful for you too!
