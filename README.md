# Introduction

Hello there! I'll cut to the chase;

I've started preparing for the Offensive Security Certified Professional exam and certification. Very early into my preparation, I realised that I needed to make my own notes of all the boxes and concepts I came across. What better way do make notes than to do it publically, in a way others can see them and hopefully gain something!

I will be primarily following [@TJ\_Null](https://twitter.com/TJ_Null)'s OSCP like VM's list and also be documenting the concepts and techniques I found to be important for myself.
